            My Process 
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; I put together this collection of poems centering around the idea of perspective.
             With a heavy focus on the world from a child's perspective.  I found myself initially 
             drawn to children's poetry by authors such as Dr. Seuss and Shell Silverstien (although 
             I didn’t feature their works in my collection). I think what I liked best about these poems 
             were their short and easy to digest sentences. They were able to convey meaningful stories 
             through simple sentences. Whereas other poets used more complex language that bogged down 
             their message. I found comfort in the poems written from the perspective of a child. They 
             used language to signify innocence and wonder. It made me think back to a simpler time in my
              life. As I continued to sift through the world of poetry, I found myself coming back to 
              poems with the topic of perspective; some from adults, others from children, and even some 
              poems that considered the perspective of animals. Reading these works helped bring me out 
              of my self-centered view on the world. I was left with so many questions after reading, and
               I hope the reader will ask themselves these questions as well. 
            <br>
            <br> 
            
            On Perspective 
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; Now I want to take a minute to preface the topic of perspective, as it is not an 
            easy topic to digest.  The idea of perspective , in of itself, can be looked at from
            multiple perspectives. Going back to our most simplest form, that of an infant, 
            we are only aware of our own viewpoint. You can see this with toddlers playing hide 
            and seek. They cover their eyes thinking “if I can’t see you, you can’t see me”. To
            an adult this logic is clearly flawed. But It is only with growth that one can see
            beyond themselves. The first step is understanding the physical world. 
            Understanding how things interact with each other. Understanding that the sun 
            doesn’t disappear just because it is night. Understanding that things don’t really 
            shrink as they get farther away. As one reaches their teen years, they have a firm 
            grasp on the literal meaning of perspective.  
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; The next step, one which I haven’t fully mastered, is to recognize ideological perspectives.
            What I mean by ideological perspectives is the way people Interpret information. Just as 
            everyone's eyes do not convey the same picture of reality, our minds all process information
            in different ways. The way one processes information is the product of both biological and 
            environmental factors. But I guess what I'm trying to point out here is that not everyone 
            sees the world the same way. And it is important for us to consider others opinions outside
            of our own. I think we need to realize this more often, instead of being mad when people 
            disagree with us or misunderstand us. Many of the poets in this collection, being 
            knowledgeable about the world, can accept others for who they are. They don’t yell or force
            ideas onto others. Instead, they cherish the diversity of others.

                This poem shows the contrast between the father and daughters view of the world.
                 I chose this poem because of it’s ability to bring everything full circle. 
                 The author starts with a statement that is otherwise meaningless and builds meaning 
                 into it through the poem. His daughter's words become a symbol of innocence.

                In this poem the author shares his beliefs about how children should see the world. 
                I appreciate his effort to protect the viewpoints of children. However, I think it’s 
                a bold statement to group all children into one category since everyone matures at a 
                different rate.

                 This poem is heavier than the two preceding it. 
                 I included it to show that not only children are 
                 protected from the truth, but whole generations as well. 
                 I like how the author points out a cycle, wherein each 
                 generation lets go of the past for the world to move on.
                 It also begs the question: should we remember the past?

                I found this poem fascinating as it shows how symbols are man-made.
                 The poet starts off with an easily recognizable symbol, the American Eagle.
                  The poet then flips our understanding of the American Eagle by making us 
                  look at it from a perspective other than our own. Suddenly, all the meaning
                   we have built into the symbol disappears.

                I like this poem because it unveils how warped our perspectives can be. 
                Things often seem better in your head until you get there. It reminded me 
                of The Alchemist, in which the glass merchant is too scared to visit Mecca 
                in fear it won’t live up to his hopes.

        The one I didn't go on.

        I was thirteen,
        and they were older.
        I'd met them at the public pool. I must

        have given them my number. I'm sure

        I'd given them my number,
        knowing the girl I was. . .

        It was summer. My afternoons
        were made of time and vinyl.
        My mother worked,
        but I had a bike. They wanted

        to go for a ride.
        Just me and them. I said
        okay fine, I'd
        meet them at the Stop-n-Go
        at four o'clock.
        And then I didn't show.

        I have been given a little gift—
        something sweet
        and inexpensive, something
        I never worked or asked or said
        thank you for, most
        days not aware
        of what I have been given, or what I missed—

        because it's that, too, isn't it?
        I never saw those boys again.
        I'm not as dumb
        as they think I am

        but neither am I wise. Perhaps

        it is the best
        afternoon of my life. Two
        cute and older boys
        pedaling beside me—respectful, awed. When we

        turn down my street, the other girls see me ...

        Everything as I imagined it would be.

        Or, I am in a vacant field. When I
        stand up again, there are bits of glass and gravel
        ground into my knees.
        I will never love myself again.
        Who knew then
        that someday I would be

        thirty-seven, wiping
        crumbs off the kitchen table with a sponge, remembering
        them, thinking
        of this—

        those boys still waiting
        outside the Stop-n-Go, smoking
        cigarettes, growing older.

        <summary>7 Dandelion by: Julie Lechevsky  </summary>

        My science teacher said 
        there are no monographs
        on the dandelion.
            
        Unlike the Venus fly-trap
        or Calopogon pulchellus,
        it is not a plant worthy of scrutiny.
            
        It goes on television
        between the poison squirt bottles,
        during commercial breakaways from Ricki Lake.
            
        But that's how life
        parachutes
        to my home.
            
        Home, 
        where they make you do
        what you don't want to do.
            
        Moms with Uzis of reproach,
        dads with their silencers.
        (My parents watch me closely because I am their jewel.)
            
        So no one knows how strong
        a dandelion is inside,
        how its parts stick together,
        bract, involucre, pappus,
        how it clings to its fragile self.
            
        There are 188 florets in a bloom,
        which might seem a peculiar number,
        but there are 188,000 square feet
        in the perfectly proportioned Wal-Mart,
        which allows for circulation
        without getting lost.
            
        I wish I could grow like a dandelion,
        from gold to thin white hair,
        and be carried on a breeze
        to the next yard.

            The understanding of a friend.

            At hide-and-seek to God afar,
       So all who hide too well away
            Must speak and tell us where they are.

                This is the second of two poems I included by Robert Frost. 
                I found it flipping through a book we keep on our coffee table.
                 This poem feels very raw to me, as if it was written in one sitting. 
                 As if Frost wrote down everything he was thinking the instant 
                 it popped into his head. Some of the wording is clunky but that’s 
                 what makes it genuine to read.

            This is another poem that feels like a conscious stream of thought. 
            At first, it seems rather strange to tell a story in reverse. 
            But as I thought about it, we see stories in reverse all the time. 
            Such as scrolling down ones Facebook page or going thru old photo albums.

                This poem really stuck out to me. I first heard Ethan read it during a 
                poetry recitation. I like how it pairs the perspective of the mind with 
                the perspective of the eyes. As the characters physical view on the world 
                changes so does his state of mind. It also serves as a warning call. 
                For it is only too late when the character sees the world differently.

     <i>How do you know if it’s love?</i> she asks,

    you’re too young to worry about it,
    as if she has questions about Medicare

    “You’ll just know” is a lie, and one truth,
    “when you still want to be with them
    the next morning,” would involve too
    many follow-up questions. The difficulty
    with love, I want to say, is sometimes
    you only know afterwards that it’s arrived
    or left. Love is the elephant and we
    are the blind mice unable to understand
    the whole. I want to say love is this
    desire to help even when I know I can’t,
    just as I couldn’t explain electricity, stars,
    the color of the sky, baldness, tornadoes,
    fingernails, coconuts, or the other things
    she has asked about over the years, all
    those phenomena whose daily existence
    seems miraculous. Instead I shake my head.
